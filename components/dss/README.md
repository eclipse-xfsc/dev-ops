# DSS (Digital Signature Service)

The digital signature service is used to validate document signatures.
A demonstration of the digital signature service is provided [here](https://github.com/esig/dss-demonstrations.git).

A pipeline job in this repository has prepared the following image of the digital signature service: `node-654e3bca7fbeeed18f81d7c7.ps-xaas.io/dev-ops/dss@sha256:db37b0cb6e1e835155f24fca00f1ded7ddb0ffd4defa37e24cd29dca657779c5`.

A pipeline job in this repository also builds and uploads the helm chart found in [deployment/helm](./deployment/helm/).
